# Meetings

## When to have meetings

We believe everyone's time is valuable, and so we only have meetings when it's clear that:
1. There is a team decision to make
1. Active, synchronous team alignment is needed
1. The issue to be discussed needs > 30min 

Before scheduling a meeting, the meeting facilitator needs to write up and circulate the following:
1. Purpose: one sentence stating why we need to spend time on this decision or discussion
1. Outcome: clear, concrete, actionable next steps
1. Process: an agenda for the meeting, with timed sections

We don't have meetings without a Purpose, Outcome, Process, because if these haven't been identified, it's not clear the topic is worth synchronous team time.

## How we run meetings

### Notes
- All meetings have a notes doc that is shared with participants before and after the meeting. This becomes a useful artifact for remembering past decisions made, and for catching up people whose connection dropped during the meeting, or happened to be out the day of the meeting. 
- Recurring meetings share a growing notes doc with dated sections. This becomes an artifact documenting the team's work and focus over time.

### Roles
To make meetings work in an all-remote environment, and for all personality types, we require that each meetings have attendees taking the following roles:
1. Facilitator: runs the agenda, decides who speaks when
1. Note-taker: captures meeting notes inline with the Process / Agenda
1. Time-keeper: ensures agenda sections and the overally meeting runs on time, to be respectful of everyone's time

Meeting roles require time commitment. We aim to share team time commitments equally, so we rotate meeting roles weekly. 

We implement this with a spreadsheet where the rows are each person's name, and the columns are:
- Meeting Facilitator for all meetings
- Note-taker for all meetings
- Time-Keeper for all meetings
- Project Peer Reviewer
- Who's out? 

We prompt the team asynchronously to sign up for roles, and keep active tallies inline in the spreadsheet of who has taken which roles over time to help folks self-balance who picks up qhich roles equally.

## Meeting Communication Norms

### Basics
- Meetings start on time and end on time. 
- If not everyone in the meeting knows each other, the meeting starts with an ice-breaker prompt
- All meetings have a Purpose, Outcome, Process
- All meetings have a Facilitator, Note-taker, Time-keeper

### Video conferencing
We're an all-remote environment, and so all our meetings happen over video conference. We prefer video over audio, as it allows participants to pick up on nonverbal cues. We use video conference software that includes chat along with the meeting where we coordinate meeting facilitation.

### Ensuring everyone can participate
- The meeting facilitator decides who speaks and drives the agenda. Clear agendas and clear facilitation make meetings accessible to both introverts and extroverts, and also manages problematic social dynamics, like one person doing most of the talking, or talking over other participants. 
- The meeting agenda explicitly includes clearly defined sections for attendee input. 
- When attendees are prompted for input, they "raise hands" via noting they want to speak in the video conference chat area. The facilitator calls on "raised hands" in the order they were raised. 

### Creating space for complex discussion
Some people feel more comfortable with extemporaneous speaking and others need thinking and processing time. We are also aware that the person who speaks first disproportionately influences the other meeting attendees. So for complex team decisions that require careful thought, we use the following collaboration device: 
- Facilitator shares a prompt for the complex question or decision to the attendees
- Attendees take 5-10 of "quiet writing time" and capture their thoughts async
- Everyone pastes their written thoughts into the meeting's notes doc
- Everyone reviews everyone else's written notes
- Team takes turns "raising hands" to actively discuss
