# MoveOn Tech Team Handbook

The MoveOn Tech Team documents the software management strategies and processes that we use to run our all-remote team. This is a living document. We evaluate and evolve our team processes regularly, and will file PRs with processes changes as we roll these out.

We often get questions on how we manage work in an intense political and technical environment with an all-remote team, and have open-sourced our team management processes to share what we've learned, and make our processes clear and transparent. Feel free to use and share anything you find helpful in this repo. 

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, please open an issue. If you would like to
